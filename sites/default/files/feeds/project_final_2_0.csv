Penn Ketchem called. He said that the flow request was too high. Since the Cinema was scaled back by about 200 seats, the reduced predicted sewer flow was never adjusted. He will be sending us a letter.

I received a phone today from Jeff Peters at Remax regarding the remaining 39 homes at this development. He was asking about tapping fee cost. He did say he has all the addresses so I recommended he complete the sewer permit request information form for each lot and return them with the full payment of the tapping fees to insure reserved capacity. I emailed him the form and he thanked me for the information and the help.

I will give file to Scot with this question...Is there anything else they need to know?

He also mentioned this project has been on -off-on and changing.

I spoke with Scott Wissler. he would like to use the remaining capacity reservations for this project. This phase will have 21 units. They will only build as the units are sold. Currently he has buyers for 14. There is 16 or 17 reservatiosn remaining. Scott was 
questioning our accounting of the reservations. He said that the reservation for Cottage 35 should not have been made. It was an addition to an already existing residental unit. (expansion of masterbedroom and bathroom). I will review Cottage 35. 
They want to start work on June 19

Spoke with Jim Queeer, He stated that they wouldnot want the remaining sewer credits applied to his project because it is a HUD job. The distribution will be determine later but it will probably be applied to Fieldcrest III. He determined that their was 21 remaining and I determined that there was 16. There is a difference of 5 units. We will reconcile the difference at a later point. I faxed my list for his use.

SEnt a fax to Jim with the total balance due: $110,400.

Phone call with Jeff Sweater about the tapping fee&#039s. The owner Stand Anderson will be in to pay the tapping fee so that we will can continue on in our review process. The amount should be 363 gpd x 8.40 =$3,049.20.
After the drawings are reviewed we will determine an escrow amount for the inspection. We will get a new set of plans at that time.

Received phone call from Al Olah. He questioned the requirement for a forcemain discharge manhole and the downstream manhole lining requirements. Since our initial review, the elimination of the Holland Hills Pumping station due to capacity needs for teh Stonemill Project (Eshelman Farm). It is highly unlikely that the Holland Hills forcemain will ever be rerouted through the Parkfield development.

Capacity request was included in the submittal for Parkfield Phase I and approved for a total of 185 IDU&#039s. This includes Parkfield Phase I @ 54 IDU, Parkefield Phase II @ 76 IDU and Parkfield Phase III @ 55 IDU.

In Parkfield Phase I, Construction Permit #0173 was issued for a total of 185 IDU&#039s.
However, the Builders Agreement was just for Phase I of Parkfield.

(NOTE -  IN FURTHER RESEARCH TODAY IT LOOKS LIKE PARKFIELD PHASE 2 IS SHOWING 74 LOTS/IDU AND NOT 76.)

We met with the fololowing people: John Karayel- Langan Engineering,Michael Wodotinsky,James DeNave and Tony Mariso all with Heritage Land Group to discuss the Stonemill Estates Project.
The following topics were discussed:

Pumping STations- They are proposing two pumping stations because they do not have the rights of way to do anything else. They also do not show the abandonment or upgrade of the Holland Hills Pumping STation

They were reluncant to construct an interceptor to the Blue Rock station because of perceived need to go to the preservation board because of the modifications of the existing rights of way. They will investigate the routing to see if they really do need to move the rights of way.

Armstrong Interceptor- They were made aware of th problem with the Armstrong Interceptor


They will need to pay special facility fees for the Bluerock station for each unit going to Bluerock.


They proposed ways for LASA to acquire the rights of way to supply service to this development. We will see how our board reacts.

REviewed the project folder for outstanding items that would preclude them from starting work on the sewer lines again. They need to resolve the insurance certificate, roadopening permit and shop drawings.

Note that the tapping fees were paid in 2004. They paid 4 units x $3,250= $13,000. Since the tapping fee is now reduced to $2,000 per unit, I reviewed the folder to see if they should be charged the lesser amount. Based on how the capacity was requested, they figured their needed capacity based on a gallon per day  basis and then converted by 350 gpd/edu. They initially requested 1,400 gpd. If we use the current rate, they can be issued a permit for 1,547 gallons per day. Since it is close, we will leave it alone. I confered with Kathy S. on this.

1.	The Industrial Waste Discharge Permit will need to be revised. We are currently revising it.
2.	As per my July 25, 2006 letter, you will need to submit a construction cost estimate and post financial security for the work.

Based on conversations with Mike Kyle, we will accept the project without specific financial security for this phase of the project. Reason is that the entire project was secured through Manor Township before we began accepting financial security.

Its hard to know where the""landings at Eagles Heights"" begins and the old project ends. The following is a summary for the entire project to determine which units need to pay the fee

209 permits issued, 124 permits have not been issued. All total 333 idu&#039s

Charles and Kicera reserved 280 units in the Bluerock Agreement. 

Of the 124 remaining permits, there are 13 single family  units that have not been permitted. We will consider these part of the original project included in the Bluerock Agreement. The next 58 units will also not need to pay the special facilities fee which will equal the 280 units reserved in the Bluerock Agreement.

The last 53 units will need to pay the additional $289 special facilities fee.

The project Permits are all processed, but 12 remain to be picked up and paid for by 5/8/07 or he will have to Renew Capacity Reservation and pay the $100/idu fee. Randy thanked me for calling and said he expects to pick up and pay for all the permits by 4/28/07. I told him in that case I would not send him the renewal notice at this time.

Received a revised capacity proposal from Joe Eisenour: 

73,000 gal used over 23 days = 3174 gpd
Round to 3,200 gpd
The summary of the amounts owed would be as follows:
There are two prepaid connection permits for 1,050 gpd.
To reserve sewer capacity by either paying the yearly reservation fee or by paying for the connection fees. To reserve by paying the reservation fee the cost would be as follows:
3,200 gpd ? 1,050 gpd (prepaid) = 2,150 gpd x $0.42/gpd= $903 per year until connected
To reserve by payment of the connection fee, the cost would be:
3,200- 1050 gpd (prepaid)= 2,150 x $8.40/ gpd = $18,060

Mr. Stumpf has asked for reconsideration of his requested sewer capacity. He would like the quarterly flow averaged for the year since his business is closed in the winter months. Based on conversations with Mike Lehman we agreed that since the benchmarking was based on average year flows, then there is some reason to approve his request.

His request will probably go from 1,000 gpd to 588 gpd.

Comments by:Scot Fertich 12/15/2006 9:21:06 AM

Since there is two buildings and each building will have its own lateral. We should rewrite the existing permit and create two permits with the prepaid flow split between the two connection points.

BECAUSE the Developer neglected to install meters as requested, the billing will all be on Account #079399 with Permit #29182 as the Main Permit.
The prepaid permit #29531 that came over from Manheim Township as non-connect will be a Sub-permit for this Account along with new Permit #31633 as another Sub-permit with the Capacity from Permit #29182 Split between the two.
BECAUSE the Development of this Project consists of 3 Separate Buildings and could potentially be sold and/or Subdivided each Building still has its&#039 own Permit.
CAPACITY = 2,100 GPD, + 945 GPD + 945 GPD = 3,990 GPD TOTAL CAPACITY.

I spoke with Steve Ziemer about the need for a road opening permit for cutting the wyes into the line. Steve said that he will only be issuing the r.o.p after Skip Mellinger comes back from Florida. But the borough is fine with Abel doing the work now. I told Steve that we are ok with this and will waive the requirement for a rop since he is dealing with Abel a different way.

They have now expanded the project to include a restroom in the field along Harrisburg Avenue. We will use the same escrow file. Permit has already been issued for this project. We need to determine if they get a new permit or they can use the existing permit for the previous restrooms. We are exploring connection options. One of the options will be to tie into the new lateral to the tennis court restrooms. I sent a fax to Harbor engineering indicating our preference for a connection location.

Spoke with Mark Shrift with Haze large archetects about the proposed restroom facility. We were concerned about the layout of the sewer lateral and the use of an existing connection point because there would be too many bends in it. Now Mark is telling me the line was installed the way they wanted and he could not confirm if it was ever inspected. He could not say if a planning module exemption was ever obtained for it. He could not confirm if we ever approved the layout that was built.

He said that he will confirm the status of the construction of the sewer line and get back to us.

Met with Mark Shrift to discuss the restrooms for the athletic fields. He said the sewer service line has been built. Upon looking at our records, the line was not approved and we do not think it has been inspected. To solve this, Mark was told to: Submit plans for LASA&#039s review, Test the sewer lateral, Apply for a connection permit and pay the fee of $2000

There is an existing partially used easement on this project. The easement should be extinguished since it has no use in the future. The owner wants to enjoined the two lots Lot 34 and Lot 33 for expansion of his business in the future. We have agreed to extinguish a portion of the unused easement to accommodate this future expansion. We have agreed to approve a connection permit for the initial building with the understanding that the financial security will not be released until either the right of way is extinguished or the idea is abandoned.

We received a planning modul exemption from PA DEP but LASA never granted its approval. The exemption was signed by Mark Stivers of East Hempfield Township. I called Mark and explained the process of including LASA in the approval process. Usually we will supply a letter stating that we are not aware of any overloads that would be affected by this project for the next five year. Mark said that he appreciated the phone call because he was preparing some flow charts and sop&#039s for permitting procedures

I spoke to Pete today. He will be using the existing sewer lateral. They will need to use a grinder pump station. He already has a concrete septic tank on site to use as a pump wetwell. He was not aware of our requirements for the grinder pumps. He will contact Monarh for the required Myers Pumps and get a recommendation on converting that tank to something that will accomodate the Myers PUmps such as pump rails, floats, conduit seal-offs etc.

Lift has paid for 6 edu&#039s. Since we base all commercials on gallons per day, we need to determine what gpd/edu to us. Normally we would consider an existing edu as 350 gallons per day. But since we made a refund when the  tapping fees we should use the new 238 gallons per day per edu factor. If this is the case, the Lift owners will need to pay us the money back that we originally refunded in order to maintain the same capacity level.???

It has been determined that we did not refund Lift Inc. any tapping fee payments as previously mentioned.  (Originally we were going to refund $, however after further thought by Customer Service we did not, assuming they would need all the gpd/edu they paid. The original permit reflects that, however it was not ""re-changed"" to the ""copy"" of the permit in the project folder.)

Customer requested 50% reduced capacity.  Non-connected, Paid Permit #17418 will be adjusted as follows:
Reduce Capacity from 2,100 GPD to 1,050 GPD
Refund $10,600.00 on our Check #19962 and keep $8,820.00 for the 1,050 GPD x $8.40/GPD

Based on conversations with Tom Malinich, he will construct a separate lateral for the second unit on the parcel because it may be subdivided at some point. I think he may be thinking of creating a ""condo"" association for these two units. To keep it cleaner if there is a blockage problem it would be better overall for there to be two separate laterals. 

Fees- Unit #1- we will $35 for the inspection of the new service line and for Unit #2 we will need a tapping fee of $2000 plus the $35 inspection

This project connects into the Manor Oaks Pumping Station. I looked at the remaining capacity 8in the station and including the Haverstick Farm reservtion of 286 units. There was still adequate capacity. The recent developer of the Haverstick farm never reserved capacity in the Manor Oaks Station so they do not have claim to any capacity.

We have not decided if we will consider this a fulll service senior facility. There is sufficient existing capacity that they will not need to purchase tapping fees. So this will only become an issue when it comes to billing.

An explanation of the decisions we made concerning the connection of this existing building for use as offices. 

As a result of questions raised during the review of plans for the subdivision of the Moore Business Park, it was determined that this existing building was on a septic system.  The following determinations were made:  

o	The other existing buildings in this section are connected to the Sewer System through the lines on the Thermacore Property.
o	The existing Moore Business Park buildings are served with public water provided through the Thermacore Property.
o	The water used by this proposed connection is already being metered and billed.
o	LASA will allow this connection to be done under the existing permit # 29192.
o	There will be no additional fee charged for this connection.
o	A copy of the existing permit will be picked up and signed for by the owner or his plumber.
o	Inspection fees will be deducted from the $225.00 escrow paid on March 10, 2009.

As per Doug Mathews the existing store portion on the site is currently not connected to the public sewer and utilities an on-lot treatment system. When they on-lot is taken out of service we can add this connection to the septic system editor so we can include the nutrient offsets.

Skip Mellinger wants to have two laterals installed now because Sylvan Retreat road is to be paved by the Borough. The parcel has not been subdivided yet and when it happens it will be a total of 6 idu&#039s. Two laterals off of Sylvan and four laterals off of Huntington. When parcel is subdivided we will continue the approval process. Keep escrow folder open till that time.

Scott

Lisa Douglas (director of planning and zoning) and Phil Mellott (Township engineer) looked at the lot plan and the easement was shown on the plan. 

However, it appears a subdivision plan has not been officially recorded. A building permit will not be issued until the plan is officially recorded. The Township building permit process includes compliance with building codes as well as planning and zoning regulations prior to approval/permit issuance.

The parcel once contained a pumping station owned by either a developer or Manheim Township. Pumping station has since been removed and is incorporated into the building lot. Owner needs to get  an easement (according to the Township) for that portion of the sewer service line that crosses the former pumping station site.
